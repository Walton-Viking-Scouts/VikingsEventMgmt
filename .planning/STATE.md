## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7 phases following dependency order -- sections first (referenced by all), flexi last (highest complexity)
- [Roadmap]: Cross-cutting requirements (XCUT) split between Phase 1 (infrastructure) and Phase 7 (validation of end-to-end flow)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 6 (Flexi Records) flagged as highest risk -- three interrelated stores with complex query patterns. May need research-phase during planning.
- REQUIREMENTS.md listed 31 total v1 requirements but actual count is 40. Traceability section corrected.
