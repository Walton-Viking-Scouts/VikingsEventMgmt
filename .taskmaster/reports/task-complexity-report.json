			"taskId": 25,
			"taskTitle": "Implement FlexiRecord Data Loading and Field Mapping Hook",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation into: (1) FlexiRecord discovery logic, (2) field mapping utility, (3) validation utility, (4) hook structure and state management, (5) error/loading/empty state handling, (6) unit test coverage for all scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves custom hook creation with dynamic data loading, field mapping, validation, and robust error handling using React Query and TypeScript. It requires modular utilities, strong typing, and comprehensive test coverage, aligning with best practices for scalable, maintainable hooks[2][3]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 26,
			"taskTitle": "Transform and Process Member Data from FlexiRecords",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) member data extraction, (2) age calculation integration, (3) assignment term logic, (4) grouping by term, (5) functional pipeline unit tests.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires extracting and transforming data, integrating business logic, and grouping results using functional programming patterns. It demands clear TypeScript interfaces and robust testing, but is less complex than custom hook creation due to fewer async and error states[2][3]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 27,
			"taskTitle": "Refactor UI State Management to Single Assignment Map",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) Map-based state refactor, (2) component updates for new state shape, (3) removal of optimistic logic, (4) integration and regression tests.",
			"reasoning": "Refactoring state management to a unified Map structure simplifies updates and data flow, but requires careful migration, component updates, and regression testing to ensure correctness and performance[3][4]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 28,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Term Assignment and Override Logic in UI",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: (1) term dropdown population and selection, (2) immediate state update logic, (3) validation for incomplete assignments, (4) accessibility and controlled component tests.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating assignment logic into the UI with controlled components and accessibility features is moderately complex, requiring careful state handling and validation, but follows established patterns for React forms and accessibility[3][4]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 29,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Batched Save and Reload Workflow with Error Handling",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) assignment grouping for batch API calls, (2) multiUpdateFlexiRecord integration, (3) post-save reload and recalculation, (4) loading/progress indicators, (5) success/error notification logic, (6) error handling for network/permission/incomplete data.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex workflow orchestration: batching API calls, handling async state, robust error management, and user feedback. It requires advanced React Query mutation patterns, UI state synchronization, and comprehensive error handling, making it high complexity[3][4]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 30,
			"taskTitle": "Comprehensive Testing and Data Integrity Validation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) automated E2E test setup, (2) data integrity validation, (3) edge case and backward compatibility tests, (4) error handling scenarios, (5) manual QA for accessibility and performance.",
			"reasoning": "End-to-end and regression testing across multiple scenarios, including data integrity and backward compatibility, is complex but follows established testing frameworks and patterns. Manual QA adds further depth, but the task is bounded by standard testing practices[3][4]."
