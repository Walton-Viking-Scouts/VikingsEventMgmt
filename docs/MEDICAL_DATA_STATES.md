# Medical Data State Indicators

## Overview

The application now provides visual indicators to distinguish between different states of medical information for members. This helps identify where medical data is missing versus where users have explicitly indicated "None" or "N/A".

## Data States

### ðŸ”´ Missing (Red Badge)
- **When shown**: Field is empty, null, or undefined
- **Action needed**: Information should be collected and updated
- **Examples**: Empty allergies field, no medical details provided

### âœ… None (Green Badge) 
- **When shown**: User has explicitly entered variations of "none", "no allergies", etc.
- **Action needed**: No action - this is confirmed safe information
- **Examples**: "None", "No allergies", "No dietary requirements"

### âšª N/A (Gray Badge)
- **When shown**: System default values or "not applicable" 
- **Action needed**: No action - field not relevant for this member
- **Examples**: API-provided "N/A" values

### ðŸ“‹ Present (Blue Badge)
- **When shown**: Member has actual medical information recorded
- **Action needed**: Review information for accuracy
- **Examples**: "Peanut allergy", "Asthma inhaler required"
